# romannumerals usefull for TDD / PBT 

The Kata says you should write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals: eg

     1 --> I
     10 --> X
     7 --> VII

For a full description of how it works, take a look at http://www.novaroma.org/via_romana/numbers.html : which includes an implementation of the Kata in javascript.

There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000. (The Romans themselves didnâ€™t tend to go any higher)
